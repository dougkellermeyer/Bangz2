				<h1>Tammy</h1>
				<p>I knew I was going to be a stylist since I was a kid. Quite frankly, my inspiration was getting one Toni home perm too many! My mom would give my sister and I these home perms and we'd come out looking like a pack of poodles instead of the glam queens the box promised. One day I said, "That's enough! There's got to be a better way!" And the next thing you know I was a stylist. I love what I do. Every day. I love making my clients feel pretty. It's great to see them sneak peeks at themselves as they leave the salon with a smile. I remember what bad had hair feels like and I always try to think like and feel for the person in my chair.​ </p>

				<h1>Beth</h1>
				<p>I've had this passion for hair and beauty for as long as I can remember. From curling my Mom's hair when i was four, to cutting and coloring my Barbies' hair until they had no hair left. I love making a difference in people's lives by making them feel pretty when they leave. And just listening and talking to them for an hour or so while they're here. I strive for unlimited creativity. And that starts with listening to my clients and respecting their needs. And their hair. I'm also the new mom to an adorable baby girl, Grace Marie. And I look forward to styling her hair too. </p>

				<h1>Sofia</h1>
				<p>From the moment I knew what styling hair was, it was all I wanted to do. Both of my parents were hairdressers. And even as a kid, I used to trap my family and friends in the bathroom and make them let me do their hair! Cuts. Colors. I couldn't help myself! I was obsessed. Needless to say, I went to school and learned how to do it right, and now I'm doing what I know I was born to do. I love changing people's looks and attitudes. Creating looks that are artistic and modern, yet maintainable is what I strive to do for each client. Face it, great hair makes people happy. And that makes me happy! </p>

				<h1>Jackie</h1>
				<p>As the daughter of a Master Barber, I grew up hanging around the barber chair. I began to cut hair at 13 years old, basically for anyone that would let me. To my surprise, they kept coming back for more! I don't believe people should have to settle for a bad haircut, and simply be told," It's only hair, it will grow back!" My philosophy is this..."You have to look in the mirror everyday, and either love, or hate your hair!" So I strive to give my clients -- both men and women -- The Perfect Cut, and keep them coming back. So don't settle, don't make today another "Hat Day." Love your hair!</p>

				<h1>Shelia</h1>
				<p>I don’t remember if its when I mixed food coloring with flour to color the neighborhood kids hair or when my friend’s mother called mine upset that I cut her “Chrissy” doll’s hair; shortly after that I spent my Saturdays at my father’s salon sweeping floors and folding towels. 39 years later I still sweep floors and fold towels however, now its after haircuts, coloring, highlights, perms and creating other looks on both women and men. Adding beauty and confidence to people’s looks is my daily goal. </p>

				<h1>Tessa</h1>
				<p>Tessa is the next generation here at Bangz! This talented, young barber & stylist may be Tammy's daughter, but she's a rising star in her own right. We're waiting for her to write her bio, but in the meantime, follow along with her on Instagram at <span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tessa_does_hair/">tessa_does_hair</a></span></p>

				<h1>Rebecca</h1>
				<p>As long as I can remember, beauty, style and fashion have always been passions of mine -- head to toe. So it's not much of a wonder that I got into doing manis and pedis. (I have to confess, I'm kind of disappointed my young daughter doesn't feel the same way.) Manis and pedis complete your look, lets you feel polished and pulled together. And it's not just  a summer thing -- a manicure or pedicure is a great way to take care of yourself year round. I love to meet new people and make you feel good with a fresh, new manicure or totally relaxed in my pedicure chair as I pamper you. I can't wait to meet you!​​​
