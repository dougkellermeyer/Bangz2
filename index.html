							<p class="stylistBackgroundText">I knew I was going to be a stylist since I was a kid. Quite frankly, my inspiration was getting one Toni home perm too many! My mom would give my sister and I these home perms and we'd come out looking like a pack of poodles instead of the glam queens the box promised. One day I said, "That's enough! There's got to be a better way!" And the next thing you know I was a stylist. I love what I do. Every day. I love making my clients feel pretty. It's great to see them sneak peeks at themselves as they leave the salon with a smile. I remember what bad had hair feels like and I always try to think like and feel for the person in my chair.​ Follow me <span><a class="socialHandle" href="https://www.instagram.com/bangzsalon_rochester/">@bangzsalon_rochester</a></span>

							<p class="stylistBackgroundText">I've had this passion for hair and beauty for as long as I can remember. From curling my Mom's hair when i was four, to cutting and coloring my Barbies' hair until they had no hair left. I love making a difference in people's lives by making them feel pretty when they leave. And just listening and talking to them for an hour or so while they're here. I strive for unlimited creativity. And that starts with listening to my clients and respecting their needs. And their hair. I'm also the new mom to an adorable baby girl, Grace Marie. And I look forward to styling her hair too. </p>

							<p class="stylistBackgroundText">From the moment I knew what styling hair was, it was all I wanted to do. Both of my parents were hairdressers. And even as a kid, I used to trap my family and friends in the bathroom and make them let me do their hair! Cuts. Colors. I couldn't help myself! I was obsessed. Needless to say, I went to school and learned how to do it right, and now I'm doing what I know I was born to do. I love changing people's looks and attitudes. Creating looks that are artistic and modern, yet maintainable is what I strive to do for each client. Face it, great hair makes people happy. And that makes me happy! </p>

							<p class="stylistBackgroundText">As the daughter of a Master Barber, I grew up hanging around the barber chair. I began to cut hair at 13 years old, basically for anyone that would let me. To my surprise, they kept coming back for more! I don't believe people should have to settle for a bad haircut, and simply be told," It's only hair, it will grow back!" My philosophy is this..."You have to look in the mirror everyday, and either love, or hate your hair!" So I strive to give my clients -- both men and women -- The Perfect Cut, and keep them coming back. So don't settle, don't make today another "Hat Day." Love your hair!

Watching my mom and how hard she worked to be where she is today inspired me to follow in her footsteps . Seeing how a haircut, some highlights or a complete makeover could make a person light up in the chair was the best thing to see. I knew from then on that I wanted to be a part of that and make people feel and look beautiful!

							<p class="stylistBackgroundText">As long as I can remember, beauty, style and fashion have always been passions of mine -- head to toe. So it's not much of a wonder that I got into doing manis and pedis. (I have to confess, I'm kind of disappointed my young daughter doesn't feel the same way.) Manis and pedis complete your look, lets you feel polished and pulled together. And it's not just  a summer thing -- a manicure or pedicure is a great way to take care of yourself year round. I love to meet new people and make you feel good with a fresh, new manicure or totally relaxed in my pedicure chair as I pamper you. I can't wait to meet you!​​​ <br><br> Rebecca owns <strong>Lula Nails</strong>, located at 1801 Penfield Road, right around the corner from our salon.

						<h2>Reuzel</h2>
					</header>
					<p> Guys, you get equal play here too! We now carry the full line of Reuzel men's hair & beardcare products.
						Leen and Bertus, the creators of Reuzel started learning mens haircutting when they were just fourteen years old. With their love of classic barbering and the influences of rock n’ roll, kustom kulture and its sub cultures, it was inevitable that one day the pair would open “Schorem Haarsnijder en Barbier.”</p>
					<p>Schorem is a bit of a wordplay that gets lost in translation, it means “scumbags”, “bad boys” in Dutch, but it is also the past tense form of “I shave him”, literally meaning “I shaved him”. The “Haarsnijder en Barbier” means Haircutter and Barber in Dutch.​ To learn more about all of the fantastic Reuzel products, visit the company's website
