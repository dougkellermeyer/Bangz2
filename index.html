							hair until they had no hair left. I love making a difference in people's lives by making
							them feel pretty when they leave. And just listening and talking to them for an hour or so
							while they're here. I strive for unlimited creativity. And that starts with listening to my
							clients and respecting their needs. And their hair. I'm also the new mom to an adorable baby

							couldn't help myself! I was obsessed. Needless to say, I went to school and learned how to
							do it right, and now I'm doing what I know I was born to do. I love changing people's looks
							and attitudes. Creating looks that are artistic and modern, yet maintainable is what I
							strive to do for each client. Face it, great hair makes people happy. And that makes me

							me. To my surprise, they kept coming back for more! I don't believe people should have to
							settle for a bad haircut, and simply be told," It's only hair, it will grow back!" My
							philosophy is this..."You have to look in the mirror everyday, and either love, or hate your
							hair!" So I strive to give my clients -- both men and women -- The Perfect Cut, and keep
							them coming back. So don't settle, don't make today another "Hat Day." Love your hair!

							sweeping floors and folding towels. 40+ years later I still sweep floors and fold towels

				<h2>Reuzel</h2>
			</header>
			<p> Guys, you get equal play here too! We now carry the full line of Reuzel men's hair & beardcare products.
				Leen and Bertus, the creators of Reuzel started learning mens haircutting when they were just fourteen
				years old. With their love of classic barbering and the influences of rock n’ roll, kustom kulture and
				its sub cultures, it was inevitable that one day the pair would open “Schorem Haarsnijder en Barbier.”
			</p>
			<p>Schorem is a bit of a wordplay that gets lost in translation, it means “scumbags”, “bad boys” in Dutch,
				but it is also the past tense form of “I shave him”, literally meaning “I shaved him”. The “Haarsnijder
				en Barbier” means Haircutter and Barber in Dutch.​ To learn more about all of the fantastic Reuzel
				products, visit the company's website

					<h2>Aluram</h2>
				</header>
				<p> From day one we knew Aluram was going to be

					Different. It had to be different.

					So we set out to "build the brand backwards” with a simple formula: Prioritize salons & stylists
					first.

					Salons are the heart of our industry and wonderful assets to our community. Beyond beautiful hair,
					many
					stylists are our friends and on some days our therapists too. So we decided to start something
					special-
					a relationship where we developed, listened and grew with salons. We heard: “build us an elevated
					brand
					with clean ingredients, that is accessible to all” and we went to work.

				</p>
				<p>
					It was love at first blowout. The passion for Aluram has been astounding, and our small-but-mighty
					line
					is growing. We also have a constant reminder of our devotion to salons and clean beauty right in our
					name: Aluram is Marula backwards! It’s fun to see people’s faces when the realization “clicks”. It's
					a
					reflection of our backwards approach and creating beauty beyond compromise. Click
