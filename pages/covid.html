            The salon has new guidelines that we will be following that are mandated by NYS.  It is very important that you feel comfortable and safe at our salon. Please do not hesitate to reschedule for a later date if you are uncomfortable coming in, we understand and will do our best to find you a new appointment date. Please reschedule if you are not feeling well.
        </p>
